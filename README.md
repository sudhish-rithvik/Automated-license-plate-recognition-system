# Automated-license-plate-recognition-system
A Python-based ANPR system using OpenCV and Tesseract OCR to detect and read vehicle number plates. Captures and logs the vehicle image, number, date, and time for secure entry/exit tracking. Developed during my internship at Rane Group for real-world deployment at office gates.
